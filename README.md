# YadBomb

## About

YadBomb is a graphical tool to install Fullmetal5's bluebomb exploit into your wii mini

It uses [Fullmetal5's bluebomb exploit](https://github.com/Fullmetal5/bluebomb) with the instructions from [Leseratte's guide](https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Thread/59342-Installing-Homebrew-on-the-Wii-Mini/)

This software will NOT install any cIOS into your console, it will install only the **Homebrew Channel**, if you want to install cIOS, feel free to check the [full guide by Leseratte](https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Thread/59342-Installing-Homebrew-on-the-Wii-Mini/)

This software is NOT the exploit itself, it will just provide a **graphical** way to use the existing [bluebomb exploit](https://github.com/Fullmetal5/bluebomb)
