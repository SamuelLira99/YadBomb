# YadBomb

## About

YadBomb is a graphical tool to install Fullmetal5's bluebomb exploit into your **Wii mini** or **normal Wii**

It uses [Fullmetal5's bluebomb exploit](https://github.com/Fullmetal5/bluebomb)

This software will NOT install any cIOS into your console, it will install only the **Homebrew Channel**. If you want to install cIOS into your **Wii mini**, feel free to check the [full guide by Leseratte](https://forum.wii-homebrew.com/index.php/Thread/59342-Installing-Homebrew-on-the-Wii-Mini/)

This software is NOT the exploit itself, it will just provide a **graphical** way to use the existing [bluebomb exploit](https://github.com/Fullmetal5/bluebomb)

## Dependencies

YadBomb depends on `yad`, a package that provides the GTK dialogs to be used from inside shell script

The script will try to install `yad` by itself

YadBombs also depends on `xterm`, that is installed by default in **almost** any distro
